# mayhem-html5

HTML5 version of the classic Amiga game Mayhem

The original game by [Espen Skoglund](http://hol.abime.net/3853) was born in the early 90s on the Commodore Amiga. That was the great time of MC68000 Assembly.

Around 2000 we made a [PC version](https://github.com/devpack/mayhem) of the game in C++.

It was then ported to [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) by [Martin O'Hanlon](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mayhem-pi), even new gfx levels were added.
